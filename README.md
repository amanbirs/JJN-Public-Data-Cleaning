# JJN-Public-Data-Cleaning

This folder is made to host datasets that are of value across multiple projects. The
data in this folder is typically publicly available and in most cases is copied from a 
source on the internet. As this folder contains a large number of datasets from different 
sources please set a clear filename for the data. Data in this folder should be saved in 
an open and easily accessible format. Preferably, as a .csv file. Do not save word 
documents, .pdf files, images or other such documents in this folder. As much as possible 
avoid saving software specific files (.R, .dta, etc.).

All data downloaded is saved in the folder "Raw Data". This data is not be used directly.
The raw data should be cleaned using the cleaning do-file in the folder "Do-Files". Using
that do-file, the cleaned data should be saved in the "Cleaned Data" folder for use. 

Feel free to save the data in any format you think you will use, but also save a .csv copy
for others to use.


This folder is NOT for:
1. Data that contains any personally-identifiable information.
2. Primary data, either paid for or collected by JJN. That should be saved offline in an
encrypted folder and backed up on our data-backup hard drive.
